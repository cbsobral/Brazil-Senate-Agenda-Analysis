# Brazil-Senate-Agenda-Analysis

This repository contains the code and analysis for the project titled "Brazilian Senate Parties and Bolsonaro's Political Agenda (2019-2020)". The project aims to assess the resonance of three dimensions of Bolsonaro's political agenda within the discussions held in the Brazilian Senate. The study analyzes the collection of speeches made in the Senate from 2019 to 2020.

The analysis begins by exploring the composition of the Brazilian Senate in terms of party, state of origin, and gender. Party ideologies are compared using the Right-Left scale based on Senate speeches and a media assessment. Party positions are estimated using the manifestos from the 2018 presidential elections. The study further examines the three dimensions of Bolsonaro's agenda: economy, security, and gender & family, and assesses their prevalence and differentiation in the Senate speeches.

Key findings indicate that economic discussions in the Senate are more polarized, with distinct vocabulary and topics associated with different party positions. However, security and gender & family dimensions show less prevalence in the corpus and do not suggest a strong differentiation in the vocabulary employed. The study also discusses the implications of these findings and highlights the role of opposition parties in shaping the Senate's response to Bolsonaro's agenda.

The repository includes the data preprocessing, analysis code, visualizations, and the final project report. It provides insights into the political discourse in the Brazilian Senate and contributes to the understanding of the alignment between political parties and Bolsonaro's political agenda during the period of 2019-2020.
